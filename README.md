## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use these scripts, ensure you have:
- A Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows).
- **Bash** (version 4.0 or higher, typically pre-installed).
- Basic command-line tools (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, etc.), usually available by default.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (to clone the repository).

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Scripts_Automation_For_Bash.git
   cd Scripts_Automation_For_Bash
   ```

2. **Make Scripts Executable**:
   Most scripts need executable permissions. Run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. **Optional: Add Scripts to PATH**:
   To run scripts from anywhere, copy them to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):
   ```bash
   sudo cp scripts/*.sh /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

Each script in the `scripts/` directory includes a header with usage instructions and examples. To run a script:
1. Navigate to the script's directory (e.g., `cd scripts/file_management`).
2. Check the script's comments or `README.md` for specific usage.
3. Execute the script, e.g.:
   ```bash
   ./file_cleanup.sh ~/Downloads
   ```

### Example: File Cleanup Script
The `file_cleanup.sh` script organizes files by extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`) into separate folders.
```bash
./scripts/file_management/file_cleanup.sh ~/Downloads --dry-run
```
- `~/Downloads`: Directory to clean.
- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without applying them.
